## OTPVerification Component
**Original Path:** `/src/components/auth/OTPVerification.tsx`
**Backup Path:** `/src/components/auth/OTPVerification.tsx.backup`

This component handled the OTP input and verification UI with:
- 6-digit OTP input with auto-focus
- Countdown timer showing expiration
- Resend OTP functionality
- Eldercare-optimized large inputs
- Voice readout support

Key features:
- Auto-advance between input fields
- Paste support for full OTP
- Visual feedback for success/error states
- Accessibility with ARIA labels

---

## OTP Library
**Original Path:** `/src/lib/auth/otp.ts`
**Backup Path:** `/src/lib/auth/otp.ts.backup`

This library managed OTP generation and storage with:
- In-memory OTP storage (Map-based)
- 6-digit secure OTP generation
- 10-minute expiration
- Rate limiting for resends
- Different OTP purposes (signup, login, deletion)

Key functions:
- `generateOTP()` - Created 6-digit codes
- `storeOTP()` - Stored with metadata
- `verifyOTP()` - Validated and consumed OTPs
- `hasValidOTP()` - Checked for existing valid OTPs
- `clearExpiredOTPs()` - Cleanup function

---

## Verify OTP Route
**Original Path:** `/src/app/api/auth/verify-otp/route.ts`
**Backup Path:** `/src/app/api/auth/verify-otp-route.ts.backup`

This API endpoint handled OTP verification for signup with:
- OTP validation against stored codes
- User creation in Firebase after verification
- Session token generation
- Rate limiting protection

Flow:
1. Validate OTP format (6 digits)
2. Check OTP validity and expiration
3. Retrieve stored signup data
4. Create Firebase user
5. Mark OTP as used
6. Return success with user data

---

## Complete Profile Route
**Original Path:** `/src/app/api/auth/complete-profile/route.ts`
**Backup Path:** `/src/app/api/auth/complete-profile-route.ts.backup`

This API endpoint completed user registration after OTP verification with:
- Firebase user creation with password
- User profile creation in Firestore
- Welcome email sending
- Session creation

Flow:
1. Validate user data (email, password, name)
2. Verify user doesn't already exist
3. Create Firebase Auth user
4. Create Firestore user document
5. Send welcome email
6. Return success response

---

## Why These Were Removed

The OTP-based system had critical issues in serverless environments:

1. **Memory Storage Problem**: OTPs were stored in memory, but Vercel's serverless functions don't share memory between instances
2. **State Management**: Different function instances couldn't access the same OTP data
3. **Reliability**: Users frequently encountered "OTP not found" errors
4. **Complexity**: Required multiple API calls and state management

## Migration Benefits

The new email verification link system:
- ✅ Uses Firestore for token storage (persistent)
- ✅ Works reliably in serverless environments
- ✅ Simpler user experience (one click)
- ✅ Better security (tokens can't be guessed)
- ✅ Professional branded emails
- ✅ No timing/expiration UI complexity

## Recovering the Code

If you need to restore any of these files:

```bash
# View the files
cat src/components/auth/OTPVerification.tsx.backup
cat src/lib/auth/otp.ts.backup
cat src/app/api/auth/verify-otp-route.ts.backup
cat src/app/api/auth/complete-profile-route.ts.backup

# Or restore them to original locations
cp src/components/auth/OTPVerification.tsx.backup src/components/auth/OTPVerification.tsx
cp src/lib/auth/otp.ts.backup src/lib/auth/otp.ts
# etc...
```

## Notes

- The account deletion flow (`/api/account/request-deletion` and `/api/account/verify-deletion`) still uses OTP
- This can be migrated to email links in a future update if needed
- All backup files have `.backup` extension to prevent TypeScript compilation
