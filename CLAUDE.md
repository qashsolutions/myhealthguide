## Storage Quota & Downgrade Validation

**Implemented:** Jan 18, 2026

### Downgrade Validation Rules

| Resource | Validation | Enforcement |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| **Members** | Must fit target plan limit BEFORE downgrade | ❌ Hard block - must remove members first |
| **Storage** | Warning shown if over target limit | ⚠️ Soft block - can downgrade but access blocked |

### Storage Quota Enforcement (Post-Downgrade)

When a user downgrades to a plan with lower storage limits and exceeds the new limit:

| Action | When Under Quota | When Over Quota |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| Upload files | ✅ Allowed | ❌ Blocked |
| View/Download files | ✅ Allowed | ❌ Blocked |
| Analyze with AI | ✅ Allowed | ❌ Blocked |
| **Delete files** | ✅ Allowed | ✅ **Always Allowed** |

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/lib/firebase/storage.ts` | `checkStorageQuota()`, `checkStorageAccessAllowed()` |
| `src/lib/firebase/planLimits.ts` | `validateDowngrade()` - checks members & storage |
| `src/app/api/documents/route.ts` | Returns `storageInfo.isOverQuota` flag |
| `src/app/dashboard/documents/page.tsx` | UI blocking when over quota |
| `src/components/subscription/DowngradeBlockedModal.tsx` | Modal showing downgrade blockers |

### User Flow

1. User on Plan B (50 MB) tries to downgrade to Plan A (25 MB)
2. If members exceed Plan A limit → **Blocked**, must remove members first
3. If storage exceeds Plan A limit → **Warning shown**, can proceed
4. After downgrade with excess storage → Documents page shows red warning, upload/view/analyze disabled
5. User deletes files to get under 25 MB → Access restored automatically

### Storage Quota Test Results (Jan 18, 2026)

**Status:** ✅ ALL TESTS PASSED (18/18)

## Shift Confirmation System (Jan 25, 2026)

## Week Strip Schedule View (Jan 25, 2026)

**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### Overview

Simplified schedule interface replacing the complex calendar view. Mobile-friendly "Week Strip + Day Expand" design that's easy to scan and act upon.

### Components

| Component | File | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| `WeekStripSchedule` | `src/components/agency/schedule/WeekStripSchedule.tsx` | Main orchestrating component with Firestore listener |
| `WeekStrip` | `src/components/agency/schedule/WeekStrip.tsx` | Horizontal 7-day bar with coverage indicators |
| `DayShiftList` | `src/components/agency/schedule/DayShiftList.tsx` | Expandable accordion showing shifts per day |
| `ScheduleAlertsBanner` | `src/components/agency/schedule/ScheduleAlertsBanner.tsx` | Clickable alerts for gaps and unconfirmed shifts |

### Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Week Strip | 7-day horizontal bar with coverage bars (green/amber/red) |
| Day Expand | Click day to expand and see shifts |
| Coverage Stats | "X/Y confirmed" with visual progress bar |
| Gap Detection | Shows unfilled shifts with "Assign" button |
| Mark Confirmed | Owner can manually confirm shifts |
| Real-time | Firestore `onSnapshot` listener for live updates |
| Role-based | Super admin sees all shifts, caregivers see only their own |

### Routes Updated

All schedule-related routes now point to `/dashboard/agency/schedule`:
- `NeedsAttentionList.tsx` - 5 routes updated
- `ManageActionGrid.tsx` - 2 routes updated
- `TodaysShiftsList.tsx` - 1 route updated
- Agency dashboard Scheduling tab - uses `WeekStripSchedule`

### Replaced Component

The old `ShiftSchedulingCalendar` (month calendar with filters) has been replaced with `WeekStripSchedule` in:
- `/dashboard/agency?tab=scheduling` (agency dashboard tab)
- `/dashboard/agency/schedule` (standalone page)

## Daily Family Notes - Email Integration

**Added:** Jan 20, 2026

### Overview

Daily Family Notes now sends **email** in addition to FCM push notifications via the Firebase Trigger Email extension.

### How It Works

1. Scheduled Cloud Function runs at 7 PM PST (with 8 PM and 9 PM fallbacks)
2. For each elder with activity, generates a daily report
3. For each group member:
   - Creates in-app notification (user_notifications collection)
   - Queues FCM push notification (fcm_notification_queue collection)
   - **NEW:** Writes email to `mail` collection (Trigger Email extension sends it)

### Email Features

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| Template | Mobile-responsive HTML with inline CSS |
| Logo | Uses favicon-32x32.png from production URL |
| Brand Colors | Blue (#2563eb) primary, professional styling |
| Content | Medications (taken/missed), Supplements, Meals, Active Alerts |
| CTA | "View Full Details" button links to /dashboard/activity |
| Footer | Unsubscribe link to /dashboard/settings |

### Email Subject Format

```
Daily Care Update for {Elder Name} - {Day, Month Date, Year}
```

Example: `Daily Care Update for Mom - Monday, January 20, 2026`

### Missing Email Handling

- If user has no email on file: Logs "Skipping email for user X - no email on file"
- FCM notification still sent regardless of email status
- Email errors are caught and logged, don't break the function

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `functions/src/index.ts` | processDailyFamilyNotes function, email template |
| `generateDailyReportEmailHTML()` | HTML email template generator |
| `formatDateForEmail()` | Date formatting for email subject |

### Testing

```bash
# Deploy functions
firebase deploy --only functions

# Test by creating a test email document
npx tsx scripts/testTriggerEmail.ts

# Manually trigger for testing (Firebase Console > Functions > sendDailyFamilyNotes > Run)
```

### Firestore Collections

| Collection | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `mail` | Email queue (Trigger Email extension reads from here) |
| `daily_family_notes` | Stores daily note summaries |
| `user_notifications` | In-app notifications |
| `fcm_notification_queue` | FCM push notification queue |

## Phase 14 - UI/UX Overhaul (Claude.ai-Inspired Navigation)

**Added:** Jan 22, 2026
**Reference Documents:** `docs/Jan22_UpdatePrompt_v1.md`, `docs/Jan22_UpdatedPrompt_v2.md`
**Design Mockups:** `docs/mockups/` (5 SVG files)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

### Overview

Complete navigation and dashboard redesign inspired by Claude.ai's minimal UI pattern. Replaces the traditional sidebar + header with a responsive icon rail (desktop) and bottom nav (mobile), adds a task priority engine, auto-suggestions, and agency-specific views.

### Phases Completed

| Phase | Description | Key Files |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | Navigation Layout | BottomNav, IconRail, MinimalHeader, MoreMenuDrawer, layout.tsx |
| 2 | Task Prioritization Engine | taskPriorityEngine, TaskPriorityContext, useTaskPriority |
| 3 | Priority Card UI | PriorityCard, DayProgress |
| 4 | Auto-Suggest System | suggestionEngine, useSuggestions, SuggestionBanner |
| 5 | Agency Views | ElderTabSelector, ShiftInfoBar |

### New Files Created (14 total)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/components/navigation/BottomNav.tsx` | Mobile bottom navigation (role-based items) |
| `src/components/navigation/IconRail.tsx` | 56px desktop left rail with tooltips |
| `src/components/navigation/MinimalHeader.tsx` | 48px sticky header with notifications/avatar |
| `src/components/navigation/MoreMenuDrawer.tsx` | Bottom sheet (mobile) / side panel (desktop) |
| `src/lib/prioritization/taskPriorityEngine.ts` | Task status calculation and prioritization logic |
| `src/contexts/TaskPriorityContext.tsx` | React context providing prioritized task data |
| `src/hooks/useTaskPriority.ts` | Consumer hooks for task priority state |
| `src/components/dashboard/PriorityCard.tsx` | Hero card showing next/overdue task with actions |
| `src/components/dashboard/DayProgress.tsx` | Horizontal progress bar with completion stats |
| `src/lib/suggestions/suggestionEngine.ts` | Context-based suggestion rules engine |
| `src/hooks/useSuggestions.ts` | Suggestion visibility and trigger management |
| `src/components/dashboard/SuggestionBanner.tsx` | Chip-style suggestion UI with dismiss |
| `src/components/agency/ElderTabSelector.tsx` | Horizontal scrollable tabs for elder switching |
| `src/components/agency/ShiftInfoBar.tsx` | Active shift timer with ending-soon warning |

### Modified Files

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` | Replaced Sidebar/DashboardHeader with new nav, added TaskPriorityProvider |
| `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` | Added PriorityCard, DayProgress, ElderTabSelector, ShiftInfoBar |

### Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Client-side only (no Firestore schema changes) | Preserves existing data layer, zero migration risk |
| Offline-aware medication logging | Uses existing `logMedicationDoseOfflineAware` |
| ±30min log matching window | Prevents duplicate logging for same scheduled time |
| ±15min due window | Task is "due now" within 15 minutes of scheduled time |
| Role-based navigation items | Different nav for Family, Caregiver, Owner roles |
| No toast library | Inline feedback to avoid new dependency |
| 60-second refresh interval | Balances freshness with Firestore read efficiency |

### Navigation by Role

| Role | Bottom Nav Items | Icon Rail Items |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Family (Plan A/B) | Home, Reports, Ask AI, More | Home, Reports, Medications, Supplements, Care Logs, Ask AI |
| Agency Caregiver | Home, Schedule, Reports, Ask AI, More | Home, Schedule, Reports, Medications, Supplements, Care Logs, Ask AI |
| Agency Owner | Home, Team, Schedule, Reports, More | Home, Team, Schedule, Reports, Analytics, Timesheets |

### Task Priority States

| Status | Criteria | Visual |
|--------|----------|--------|
| `overdue` | >15min past scheduled time, no log | Red card with alert icon |
| `due_now` | Within ±15min of scheduled time | Blue card with clock icon |
| `upcoming` | Scheduled later today | Gray card, no action buttons |
| `completed` | Log found within ±30min window | Hidden from priority card |
| `skipped` | Skip log found | Hidden from priority card |
